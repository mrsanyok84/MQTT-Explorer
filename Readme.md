# The App has moved to [mqtt-explorer.com](https://mqtt-explorer.com)
MQTT Explorer is a comprehensive and easy-to-use MQTT Client.  
Downloads can be found at the link above.

This page is dedicated to its development.
Pull-Requests and error reports are welcome.

## Run from sources

```bash
yarn
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Develop

Launch Application
```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

The `app` directory contains all the rendering logic, the `backend` directory currently contains the models, tests, connection management, `src` contains all the electron bindings. [mqttjs](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js) is used to facilitate communication to MQTT brokers.

## Automated Tests

To achieve a reliable product automated tests run regularly on travis.

  - Data model
  - MQTT integration
  - UI-Tests (The demo is a recorded ui test)

## Run UI-tests
A [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) MQTT broker is required to run the ui-tests.

Run tests with
```bash
# Run chromedriver in a separate terminal session
./node_modules/.bin/chromedriver --url-base=wd/hub --port=9515 --verbose
```

Compile and execute tests
```bash
npm run build
node dist/src/spec/webdriverio.js
```
